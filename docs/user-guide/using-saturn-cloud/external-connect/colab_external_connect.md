# Connect to Dask from Google Colab

And with that you're now ready to use Dask from Colab! You can use Dask commands from your Colab notebook to have the Saturn Cloud cluster do computations for you. You can also monitor the cluster performance and schedule jobs and deployments from the Saturn Cloud app. Check out our [getting started documentation](<docs/user-guide/quickstart.md>) for more guides, and consider whether our [Saturn Hosted Free, Saturn Hosted Pro, or Enterprise plan](/docs) is best for you!

You can also connect to Dask from [SageMaker](<docs/user-guide/using-saturn-cloud/external-connect/sagemaker_external_connect.md>), [Azure](<docs/user-guide/using-saturn-cloud/external-connect/azure_external_connect.md>), or [anywhere else outside of Saturn Cloud](<docs/user-guide/using-saturn-cloud/external-connect/azure_external_connect.md>).
