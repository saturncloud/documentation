# Billing for Saturn Cloud Pro
For the Saturn Cloud Hosted, your resources run in our AWS account. This is free for Hosted Free users, and paid for Hosted Pro and Hosted Organizations users. Under the paid plan, there is no free tier. You simply pay the [hourly rate for compute and storage](/docs). By default we will charge your account whenever you accumulate over $10 in charges, or after 30 days, whichever comes first. This can generate an excessive amount of invoices for some users. Please reach out to support@saturncloud.io to increase the billing interval - we are happy to do so.

## I'm getting charged but nothing is running

As mentioned above, in addition to charging for compute, since we pay AWS for storage, we also have to pass those costs onto users. For hard drives on workspaces, the rates $0.10 per GB/month - this calculation is based on the size of the disk, not the size of your files. For shared folders the charge is $0.30 per GB/month, based on the size of the files, rather than the size of the disk.

## I'm getting too many invoices

As mentioned above, contact support@saturncloud.io and we can increase your billing interval beyond the standard $10 default.

## I need a copy of my invoice

Please [login to Stripe](https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/8wM6s23lS8vk0sU3cc) in order to access your historical invoices. You will have to login with the email that is tied to your Saturn Cloud account. If you have trouble finding the relevant invoice, please contact support@saturncloud.io

## Can I pre-pay for credits?

If you'd like to buy more than $2000 in credits, we can send you an invoice to help you purchase credits up front. We will still need a credit card on file in case you exceed your pre-purchased amount. If you exceed your pre-purchased credits, your credit card will be charged again.

## What happens if I miss a payment?

If you miss a payment, since we've already paid AWS for the resources you've consumed, your account will be automatically downgraded to the free tier. <b>This also means that your data will be deleted after approximately 30 days of inactivity</b>. You can upgrade again at any point in the future. If you have an outstanding balance, your credit card will be charged at that time.
