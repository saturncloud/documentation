# Problems Connecting to other Sites and Services
If you're on Saturn Hosted Free, and you are having issues connecting to external sites from Saturn Cloud (either download data, or attempting to access other APIs), this is likely because you are running into our networking restrictions.

In order to prevent abuse, we restrict network connections from Saturn Cloud to known sites. But the intention is not to prohibit legitimate networking use in Saturn Cloud. If you contact support@saturncloud.io, please send us either the IP address, or the DNS address you are trying to connect to, along with an explanation of why you're trying to connect, and we can add it to the list of approved destinations.

These networking restrictions do not apply to Saturn Cloud Hosted Pro or Saturn Cloud Hosted Organization users.
