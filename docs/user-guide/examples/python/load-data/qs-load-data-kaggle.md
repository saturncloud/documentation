# Load Data From Kaggle|
| Kaggle Username  |  `kaggle-username`
| Kaggle API Key  |  `kaggle-key`

Copy the values from your "kaggle.json" file into the *Value* section of the secret creation form. You must use the provided variable names above for Kaggle to connect correctly.

With this complete, your Kaggle credentials will be accessible by Saturn Cloud resources!

### Setting Up Your Resource
First, you will need to attach your Kaggle credentials to your resource. On the resource's page, navigate to the *Secrets* tab, and then click on the *Attach Secret Environment Variable* button.

Next, add the `kaggle-username` and `kaggle-key` variables one at a time by selecting them from the dropdown list. The correct *Environment Variable Name* field will be generated by default. Once your two secrets are attached, you're ready to connect to Kaggle from your resource!

Kaggle is not installed by default in Saturn images, so you will need to install it onto your resource. This is already done in this example recipe, but if you are using a custom resource you will need to `pip install kaggle`. Check out our page on [installing packages](https://saturncloud.io/docs/user-guide/how-to/install-packages/) to see the various methods for achieving this!

### Download a Dataset
Now that you have set up the credentials for Kaggle and installed kaggle, downloading Kaggle data is really straightforward! 

In Kaggle, find the dataset you want to download. 

On the dataset page, click on the three dots to the right and select **Copy API Command**.

Now, in Saturn Cloud, create a new terminal (or open an existing one) then paste the API command. For example:


```python
kaggle datasets download -d deepcontractor/swarm-behaviour-classification
```

That's it! Your dataset will download to your current path, and you will be able to use it for calculations!

### Download a Competition Dataset
Downloading a competition dataset is similarly straightforward, but it is a slightly different process. 

In Kaggle, find the competition you want to download the dataset for.

Click on **Data** in the top menu and then copy the command displayed.

Now, in Saturn Cloud, create a new terminal (or open an existing one) then paste the API command. For example:


```python
kaggle competitions download -c titanic
```

That's it! Your dataset will download to your current path, and you will be able to use it for calculations!
