# Upgrading to Release 2021.11.10
The instructions assume that you have a terminal located in the *installation directory*. This is the directory you ran the installer from. It should contain a `config.yaml` file

## 1. Add your IP address to the EKS cluster

{{% enterprise-install/self-install-eks-ip %}}

## 2. Get credentials for the Saturn Cloud installation role.

The IAM Role is located in the `config.yaml` under the field `role_arn`. Usually this is something like `arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/saturn/customer-admin`. Grab the external id from `config.yaml` under the field `external_id`.

{{% enterprise-install/install-role-creds %}}

## 3. Setup the installer shell

{{% enterprise-install/self-install-shell image="saturncloud/saturn-aws:2021.11.10-17" %}}

### 3a. Backup all EBS volumes

{{% enterprise-install/self-install-backup %}}

### 3b. Run the upgrade

Run these commands:

```
python saturn_aws/scripts/main.py update-tf /sdata
python saturn_aws/scripts/main.py migrate -r release-2021.11.10 /sdata
python saturn_aws/scripts/main.py update-k8s /sdata
```
