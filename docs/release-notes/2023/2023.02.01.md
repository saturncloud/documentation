# Release 2023.02.01

## Jobs
Historical job logs are now organized by each run.

## Metrics

Clean up UI for hardware metrics and move them into a separate tab

## Docker in Docker

Added support for Docker in Docker for all resource types

## Shared Folders

Saturn Cloud admin users can now administer user owned shared folders

## IAM Roles

Users and groups can now have access to multiple IAM roles. IAM roles can be chosen for each resource. If a user has access to only one role, it will be attached by default.

## Security

- Previously if a customer provided us with a KMS key we would encrypt EKS secrets with it. Now we create a KMS key by default if a user does not provide one
- Saturn Cloud now makes IRSA mandatory. An upcoming release will remove all uses of IAM users by the Saturn Cloud platform. Users can still use IAM users
- Prepare for EKS 1.23 by deploying the EBS CSI driver
