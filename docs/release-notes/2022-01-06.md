# Release 2022.01.06

* The file locations in resources have been changed:
  * The default working directory is now `/home/jovyan/workspace` (previously `/home/jovyan/git-repos`).
  * The default location for git repositories is now `/home/jovyan/workspace` (previously `/home/jovyan/git-repos`). The git repository paths are also now absolute instead of relative, so they can be cloned outside of the default folder.
* When creating a resource from a template you can now choose the owner and name of the resource.
* Enterprise customers can now use **Shared Folders** to share files between resources and users.
* The git SSH keys are now part of the user settings page.
* The image page and creation process has been overhauled. Now different versions of images are connected to each other in the UI for easier management.
* Images now pull faster due to optimizations in Saturn Cloud.
