# Release 2022.09.01
## Logs
- Historical logs were previously truncated. Saturn Cloud was modified to properly display the last 1000 lines of historical logs.
- Container logs are now broken out by container, and make it easier to find errors by displaying logs from the previous container when containers are restarting.

## Reliability
Modified Kubernetes API watching to use serverside rather than clientside timeouts. This fixes the issue where Saturn Cloud UI state occasionally drifts from cluster state.

## Troubleshooting
Added a debug mode for workspaces so that users can recover when they run out of disk space.

## Collaboration
Saturn Cloud now hosts resource templates for users so that users can easily send each other projects.

## SSO
Saturn Cloud can now automatically create users based on email domains and groups that are in a customers identity provider.
