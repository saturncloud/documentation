# Release 2022.05.01

## Images

Python installations have moved from `/opt/conda` to `/opt/saturncloud` to better support external images that may already be using `/opt/conda`. Existing images that still use `/opt/conda` will continue to function normally.

## Deployments

This release adds a "debug" mode for deployments which allows users to SSH into deployments to troubleshoot issues. HTTP timeouts have also been extended to 300 seconds to support longer request/response cycles.

## Other Improvements
* Users can now choose the subdomain for deployments, workspaces, and dask clusters.
* Workspace creation forms have been redesigned.
* The Image selector is now searchable.
* Prefect Cloud flow runs are limited to last 100 entries.
* Users can run Docker within Saturn Cloud workspaces. This needs to be enabled on an installation by installation basis. Contact support@saturncloud.io to request this.
* Organization admins can create and manage groups.
* New modal guides users to create a resource if they don't have any yet.
