# November 2021 Release

## Improvements

* **Recipes** - Saturn Cloud now has recipe files that fully specify a resource. These JSON files can be used to store information about a resource, so that given a recipe file a resource can be created with it.
* **Groups** - Resources and images can now be owned by a **Group** instead of a single user. A group is a collection of users that all have access to a resource. This is valuable for shared resources like a deployment where multiple people should be able to access and edit it.
* **Resource start times** - Backend changes to GPU resources mean they should now start faster than before.
