# Connect to Dask from Azure

And with that you're now ready to use Dask from Azure! You can use Dask commands from your Azure notebook to have the Saturn Cloud cluster do computations for you. You can also monitor the cluster performance and schedule jobs and deployments from the Saturn Cloud app. Check out our [getting started documentation](<docs/quickstart.md>) for more guides, and consider whether our [Saturn Hosted Free, Saturn Hosted Pro, or Enterprise plan](/docs) is best for you!

You can also connect to Dask from [SageMaker](<docs/using-saturn-cloud/External Connect/sagemaker_external_connect.md>), [Google Colab](<docs/using-saturn-cloud/External Connect/colab_external_connect.md>), or [anywhere else outside of Saturn Cloud](<docs/using-saturn-cloud/External Connect/external_connect.md>).
