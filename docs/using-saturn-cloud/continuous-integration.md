# Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are essential practices in modern software development because they streamline the process of integrating code changes and deploying them rapidly and reliably. By automating these steps, CI/CD reduces manual errors, accelerates delivery, and ensures that your software is always in a deployable state, enhancing both the speed and quality of your development lifecycle.

Common use cases for CI/CD with Saturn Cloud are
- automating the building of images for use within Saturn Cloud
- automating the updates of deployments/jobs in Saturn Cloud

## Registering images in Saturn Cloud in CI/CD pipelines

This section assumes that you already have a CI/CD pipeline setup for building docker images.
