# Saturn Cloud on Crusoe

Saturn Cloud Enterprise for Crusoe provides a fully managed data science platform deployed directly into your Crusoe Cloud environment. Saturn Cloud Enterprise has a standard configuration for Crusoe Cloud. In a typical installation, we provision a [Crusoe Managed Kubernetes (CMK)](https://docs.crusoecloud.com/orchestration/cmk) cluster in your Crusoe project, configure CPU and GPU node pools optimized for AI workloads, and integrate with Crusoe storage and networking services. Saturn Cloud is hosted publicly with secure authentication by default, with private networking options available if required.

This standard installation creates a ready-to-use platform for machine learning and AI workloads on sustainable, cost-effective GPU infrastructure. Beyond the default setup, Saturn Cloud can customize node pool sizes, GPU configurations, and network settings to meet your organizationâ€™s needs.
