# Start Using Saturn Cloud in 10 Minutes or Less

Welcome! Getting up and running on Saturn Cloud is really fast and easy.

## Sign Up for Saturn Cloud

Sign up by visiting [saturncloud.io](https://www.saturncloud.io/s/), clicking "Start for Free", and following the instructions. If you have any struggles, we have [a full tutorial](<docs/Getting Started/signing_up.md>).

## Create a Resource

Create a Jupyter Server in your new account that you can run code on. On the **Resources** page, you can either
select from one of the pre-created template resources like the **RAPIDS** server, or set up your own by pressing
the **New Jupyter Server** button.

Once the server is created you'll need to turn it on. Press the green triangle on the resource's page to
start the server. Once started you are ready to go.

## Get to Work!

With a resource from a template, you can get to work immediately. The RAPIDS quick start, for example, lets you run GPU-accelerated data science code to process data and train machine learning models. [In this tutorial](<docs/Examples/RAPIDS/qs-01-rapids-gpu.md>), you get all the instructions to train a RAPIDS model on Saturn Cloud from start to finish.

After you've seen how much Saturn Cloud can increase your productivity, you can **choose your own adventure** and follow our other tutorials and documents to create more complex projects!

If you want to try other machine learning workflows, select a different template card to try something else!
* [Try a LightGBM example](<docs/Examples/MachineLearning/lightgbm-training.md>),
* [Or an XGBoost example](<docs/Examples/MachineLearning/xgboost-training.md>),
* [Or a scikit-learn example](<docs/Examples/MachineLearning/sklearn-training.md>)!

If you want to connect to external data sources...
* [Connect to your data](<docs/Using Saturn Cloud/connect_data.md>)!

If you want to use your own IDE instead of Jupyter...
* [Use your IDE with SSH](<docs/Using Saturn Cloud/ide_ssh.md>)!

If you want to learn more about parallelization in Python...
* [Read up on why it's a game changer and how to use it](<docs/Reference/dask_concepts.md>)!

If you want to start using a Dask cluster...
