# Start Using Saturn Cloud in 10 Minutes or Less

Welcome! Getting up and running on Saturn Cloud is really fast and easy.

## Sign Up
1. **Sign up online** by visiting [saturncloud.io](https://www.saturncloud.io/s/), clicking "Start for Free", and following the instructions. If you have any struggles, we have [a full tutorial](<docs/Getting Started/signing_up.md>).

## Create a Project
2. **Create a project** in your new account by clicking "Projects" from the lefthand menu, and selecting a "Quick Start" card. (We recommend that you start with one of our Quick Start projects, which will guide you through a full workflow from start to finish.) If anything gets confusing, visit [the complete guide](<docs/Getting Started/start_project.md>).

From there, you are ready to run code!

## Get to Work!
3. With a Quick Start project, you can get to work immediately. The RAPIDS quick start, for example, lets you run GPU-accelerated data science code to process data and train machine learning models. [In this tutorial](<docs/Examples/RAPIDS/qs-01-rapids-gpu.md>), you get all the instructions to train a RAPIDS model on Saturn Cloud from start to finish.

From inside your project, click the green arrow on the card to start the resource and begin working!

After you've seen how much Saturn Cloud can increase your productivity, you can **choose your own adventure** and follow our other tutorials and documents to create more complex projects!

If you want to try other machine learning workflows, select a different Quick-Start card to try something else!
* [Try a LightGBM example](<docs/Examples/MachineLearning/lightgbm-training.md>),
* [Or an XGBoost example](<docs/Examples/MachineLearning/xgboost-training.md>),
* [Or a scikit-learn example](<docs/Examples/MachineLearning/sklearn-training.md>)!

If you want to connect to external data sources...
* [Connect to your data](<docs/Using Saturn Cloud/connect_data.md>)!

If you want to use your own IDE instead of Jupyter...
* [Use your IDE with SSH](<docs/Using Saturn Cloud/External Connect/ide_ssh.md>)!

If you want to learn more about parallelization in Python...
* [Read up on why it's a game changer and how to use it](<docs/Reference/dask_concepts.md>)!

If you want to start using a Dask cluster...
* [Learn to create and use a cluster](<docs/Using Saturn Cloud/Create Cluster/create_cluster_ui.md>)!

And there's much more!
